# Apple Health Sleep Charts

## Overview

WellPath sleep visualizations follow Apple Health design patterns for familiarity and usability. There are 2 main chart types with different time period views.

---

## Chart Type 1: Stages View

### What It Shows
- Sleep stages over time (Awake, REM, Core/Light, Deep)
- Horizontal timeline for single nights
- Vertical bars for multi-night views

### Time Period Options

#### Day View (Single Night)
- **Orientation:** Horizontal timeline (left to right)
- **X-axis:** Time progression (e.g., 10 PM to 8 AM)
- **Y-axis:** Sleep stages stacked vertically
- **Visual Pattern:** Like a Gantt chart showing continuous time blocks
- **Color Coding:**
  - Deep Sleep: Dark blue/navy
  - Core Sleep: Teal/cyan
  - REM Sleep: Purple/blue
  - Awake: Light coral/salmon

**CRITICAL:** This is a horizontal timeline where time flows left to right, NOT a vertical bar chart.

#### Week View (7 Nights)
- **Orientation:** Vertical bars (one per night)
- **X-axis:** Days of week (Mon-Sun)
- **Y-axis:** Time of day (dynamic range based on sleep data)
- **Stacking:** Top to bottom represents bedtime to wake time
  - Top of bar = Bedtime
  - Bottom of bar = Wake time
- **Visual Pattern:** Each bar is a vertical timeline of that night's sleep

**CRITICAL:** Time flows top-to-bottom in these bars (bedtime at top, wake at bottom), NOT the typical bottom-to-top bar chart pattern.

#### Month View (30+ Nights)
- Same vertical bar structure as Week View
- More bars compressed horizontally
- May show abbreviated labels (every 3-5 days)

#### 6-Month View (26 Weeks)
- Weekly aggregated data
- Each bar represents one week's average
- Simplified stage visualization

---

## Chart Type 2: Amounts View

### What It Shows
- Duration spent in each sleep stage
- Two modes: Default (all stages) and Selected (single stage)

### Default State (No Selection)

**Stacked Bar Chart showing all stages:**
- Each bar shows total sleep composition
- Stages stacked from bottom to top: Deep, Core, REM, Awake
- Standard stacked bar chart pattern

### Selected State (Stage Tapped)

**Single Stage View:**
- All bars show ONLY the selected stage's duration
- All bars use the selected stage's color
- Percentages section highlights the selected stage
- Use case: Track REM sleep trends over time

**CRITICAL for Longer Views:** When a stage is selected in Week/Month/6M views, that stage must be repositioned to the bottom of the chart to make trends more visible.

### Time Period Options
- Day: 4 bars (one per stage category)
- Week: 7 bars (one per night)
- Month: 30+ bars (one per night)
- 6-Month: 26 bars (weekly averages)

---

## Dynamic Time Axis Calculation

### Critical Requirement
Time axes must be **dynamically calculated** based on actual sleep data, NOT fixed ranges.

### Calculation Method

```javascript
// For Week/Month views with multiple nights:
function calculateTimeAxis(sleepData) {
  // 1. Find earliest bedtime across all nights
  const earliestBedtime = Math.min(...sleepData.map(night => night.bedtime));
  
  // 2. Find latest wake time across all nights
  const latestWakeTime = Math.max(...sleepData.map(night => night.wakeTime));
  
  // 3. Add 30-60 minute buffer on each end
  const startTime = earliestBedtime - 30 * 60; // 30 min buffer
  const endTime = latestWakeTime + 30 * 60; // 30 min buffer
  
  return { startTime, endTime };
}

// For Day view with single night:
function calculateDayViewAxis(nightData) {
  const bedtime = nightData.bedtime;
  const wakeTime = nightData.wakeTime;
  
  // Add buffer
  const startTime = bedtime - 45 * 60; // 45 min buffer
  const endTime = wakeTime + 45 * 60; // 45 min buffer
  
  return { startTime, endTime };
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Axis range is different for each user and time period
- Automatically adjusts to show actual sleep patterns
- All bars in Week/Month views share the same Y-axis
- Each bar is positioned within that shared range based on its individual bedtime/wake time

---

## Summary Metrics Display

### Always Show:
- Total Sleep Time (hours:minutes)
- Average Sleep Time (for multi-night views)
- Time in Bed
- Sleep Efficiency %
- Average by Stage (percentages):
  - Deep Sleep %
  - Core Sleep %
  - REM Sleep %
  - Awake %

### Optional Metrics:
- Time to Fall Asleep
- Times Awoken
- Sleep Consistency Score (for week+ views)

---

## Color Palette

### Official Apple Health Colors:
```css
--deep-sleep: #1E3A8A;     /* Dark blue/navy */
--core-sleep: #06B6D4;     /* Teal/cyan */
--rem-sleep: #7C3AED;      /* Purple/blue */
--awake: #FB7185;          /* Light coral/salmon */
--background: #F9FAFB;     /* Light gray */
--text-primary: #111827;   /* Dark gray */
--text-secondary: #6B7280; /* Medium gray */
```

# Calculation Methods

## Standard Aggregation Functions

| Method | Name | Description | SQL Function | Example | Use Cases |
|--------|------|-------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **SUM** | Sum | Adds all values together within the time window | `SUM()` | Total steps in a week: 5000 + 6000 + 7000 = 18,000 steps | Cumulative metrics like total calories, total active time, total meals |
| **COUNT** | Count | Counts the number of occurrences within the time window | `COUNT()` | Number of meals logged this week: 21 meals | Frequency metrics like number of workouts, number of meals, number of sleep sessions |
| **AVG** | Average | Calculates the mean of all values within the time window | `AVG()` | Average sleep: (7.5 + 8 + 6.5 + 7 + 8.5 + 7 + 6) / 7 = 7.2 hours | Typical values like average heart rate, average meal size, average workout duration |
| **MIN** | Minimum | Returns the lowest value within the time window | `MIN()` | Shortest sleep session this week: 5.5 hours | Identifying lowest points like minimum blood glucose, shortest workout, earliest wake time |
| **MAX** | Maximum | Returns the highest value within the time window | `MAX()` | Longest workout this month: 90 minutes | Identifying peak values like maximum heart rate, longest fasting window, highest step count |

---

## Advanced Statistical Functions

| Method | Name | Description | SQL Function | Example | Use Cases |
|--------|------|-------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **STDEV** | Standard Deviation | Measures variability/consistency of values within the time window | `STDDEV()` | Sleep consistency: [7, 7.5, 7, 8, 7] has low STDEV (consistent); [5, 9, 6, 10, 5] has high STDEV (inconsistent) | Consistency metrics like workout duration variability, eating window consistency, glucose stability |
| **MEDIAN** | Median | Returns the middle value when sorted (50th percentile) | `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` | Median workout: 45 min (less affected by that one 3-hour hike outlier) | When outliers would skew AVG, like typical meal size, typical blood pressure |
| **MODE** | Mode | Returns the most frequently occurring value | `MODE()` | Most common meal time: 12:30 PM appears 15 times this month | Finding patterns like most common workout time, most frequent meal type |
| **RANGE** | Range | Difference between maximum and minimum values | `MAX() - MIN()` | Blood glucose range today: 140 - 80 = 60 mg/dL | Measuring spread like daily temperature variation, glucose variability |
| **CV** | Coefficient of Variation | Standard deviation divided by mean (normalized variability) | `STDDEV() / AVG()` | Activity consistency: STDEV(30) / AVG(45) = 0.67 (moderately consistent) | Comparing variability across metrics with different scales (sleep hours vs step counts) |

---

## Consistency Score Calculations

### Sleep/Wake Time Consistency

**Formula:**
```javascript
// Calculate standard deviation of times over analysis period
sleep_time_stdev_minutes = STDEV(sleep_times_over_analysis_period_in_minutes)
wake_time_stdev_minutes = STDEV(wake_times_over_analysis_period_in_minutes)
```

**Key Points:**
- Analysis period is configurable (7, 30, 90 days, or custom)
- Output in minutes (not percentages)
- Convert times to minutes from midnight for calculation
- Minimum data requirement: at least 50% of days in analysis period

**Interpretation:**
- 15 minutes STDEV = pretty consistent
- 45 minutes STDEV = somewhat inconsistent
- 90+ minutes STDEV = very inconsistent

**Why Standard Deviation:**
- More interpretable ("your wake time varies by Â±30 minutes")
- More actionable (clear improvement targets)
- Avoids arbitrary thresholds and scaling factors

---

## Most Commonly Used Calculations

### Primary (Use Most Often):
1. **SUM** - Total values over time
2. **COUNT** - Frequency of occurrences
3. **AVG** - Typical/average values
4. **STDEV** - Consistency metrics
5. **MIN/MAX** - Ranges and extremes

### Specialized (Use When Appropriate):
1. **MEDIAN** - Better than AVG when outliers present
2. **CV** - For normalized consistency across different scales
3. **MODE** - For pattern identification
4. **RANGE** - For measuring variability spread

- Used for: Daily totals, daily averages
- Calculation: `WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE`

**Weekly Window:**
- 7 consecutive days
- Options: Calendar week (Sun-Sat) or Rolling 7 days
- Used for: Weekly totals, weekly consistency scores
- Calculation: `WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - 6`

**Monthly Window:**
- 30 consecutive days OR calendar month
- Used for: Monthly averages, monthly compliance rates
- Calculation: `WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - 29`

**6-Month Window:**
- 26 weeks = 182 days
- Used for: Long-term trends, habit establishment
- Calculation: `WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - 181`

---

## Supported Window Field in Database

### Example Structure
```json
{
  "aggregation_metric_id": "AGG_021",
  "metric_name": "avg_weekly_sleep",
  "calculation_method": "AVG",
  "supported_windows": ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "6_month"],
  "default_window": "weekly",
  "chart_type": "trend_line"
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Store `supported_windows` as array or JSONB
- Keep window definitions in application code (not database)
- Use PostgreSQL ENUM for window types if preferred
- Allow multiple windows per metric for flexible display

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Fixed Time Ranges
â **Don't:** Use fixed axis ranges like 8 PM to 8 AM for all users
â **Do:** Calculate axis dynamically based on actual data

### 2. Wrong Bar Orientation
â **Don't:** Make Week Stages view bars bottom-to-top
â **Do:** Stack top-to-bottom (bedtime at top, wake at bottom)

### 3. Missing Selection State
â **Don't:** Only show stacked bars in Amounts view
â **Do:** Support both default stacked and single-stage selection

### 4. Hardcoded Time Windows
â **Don't:** Hardcode "last 7 days" in formulas
â **Do:** Make analysis period configurable

### 5. Ignoring Outliers
â **Don't:** Always use AVG for all metrics
â **Do:** Use MEDIAN when outliers are expected

### 6. Overcomplicated Consistency Scores
â **Don't:** Apply arbitrary thresholds and percentage conversions
â **Do:** Use simple standard deviation in interpretable units
