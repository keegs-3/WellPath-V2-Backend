"""
Generate realistic survey responses based on patient archetype.

Archetypes:
- high_performer: Claims and demonstrates excellent health
- struggling: Claims struggling behaviors that match poor markers
- inconsistent: Claims good behaviors but markers show otherwise (our current test case)
