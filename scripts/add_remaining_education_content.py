    'Cystatin C': {
        'education': """**Understanding Cystatin C**

Cystatin C is a protein produced by all nucleated cells in the body and filtered by the kidneys. It's a superior marker of kidney function compared to creatinine because it's less affected by muscle mass, age, sex, or diet.

**The Longevity Connection:**
- More sensitive early detector of kidney dysfunction than creatinine
- Elevated levels predict cardiovascular disease and mortality independent of creatinine-based eGFR
- Chronic kidney disease dramatically accelerates biological aging
- Each 0.1 mg/L increase is associated with 10-20% higher cardiovascular risk
- Better predictor of outcomes in elderly populations

**Optimal Ranges:**
- Optimal: 0.50-0.90 mg/L
- Normal: <1.0 mg/L
- Mild elevation: 1.0-1.2 mg/L
- Moderate elevation: 1.2-1.5 mg/L
- Severe elevation: >1.5 mg/L

**Why It Matters:**
- Detects kidney dysfunction earlier than creatinine
- Not influenced by muscle mass (unlike creatinine)
- More accurate in elderly, very lean, or very muscular individuals
- Predicts cardiovascular events independently
- Useful for medication dosing adjustments

**Causes of Elevated Cystatin C:**
- Impaired kidney function
- Hyperthyroidism
- High-dose corticosteroid use
- Smoking
- Higher body fat (modest effect)
- Inflammation
- Malignancy

**How to Lower Cystatin C:**

**Protect Kidney Function:**
- Maintain healthy blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg)
- Optimize blood sugar control (HbA1c <5.7%)
- Avoid nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics)
- Stay well-hydrated
- Limit alcohol consumption

**Lifestyle Interventions:**
- Regular exercise (150+ minutes weekly)
- Mediterranean or plant-based diet
- Maintain healthy weight (BMI 20-25)
- Quit smoking
- Manage stress
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours)

**Dietary Considerations:**
- Limit protein to 0.8-1.0 g/kg if levels elevated
- Reduce sodium (<2,300 mg/day, ideally <1,500 mg)
- Increase fruits and vegetables
- Omega-3 fatty acids from fish
- Avoid excessive phosphorus (processed foods)

**When to Retest:**
- If elevated: Recheck in 3-6 months
- Monitor annually if borderline
- More frequently if chronic kidney disease present

**Special Considerations:**
- More reliable than creatinine for eGFR calculation in special populations
- Cystatin C-based eGFR may be more accurate in elderly
- Consider combined creatinine-cystatin C eGFR for best accuracy
- Not affected by dietary protein intake""",

    'Folate Serum': {
        'education': """**Understanding Serum Folate**

Serum folate measures recent folate (vitamin B9) intake, typically reflecting the last few days to weeks. Unlike RBC folate which shows long-term status, serum folate can fluctuate with dietary changes.

**The Longevity Connection:**
- Critical for DNA synthesis and repair
- Essential for methylation pathways affecting epigenetic aging
- Low folate increases homocysteine (cardiovascular risk)
- Protects against neural tube defects in pregnancy
- May reduce risk of certain cancers (colorectal)
- Important for cognitive function and mood regulation
- Deficiency accelerates biological aging

**Optimal Ranges:**
- Optimal: >10 ng/mL (>22.6 nmol/L)
- Adequate: 4-10 ng/mL
- Low-normal: 3-4 ng/mL
- Deficient: <3 ng/mL

**Why Both Tests Matter:**
- Serum Folate: Recent dietary intake (days-weeks)
- RBC Folate: Long-term status (2-3 months)
- Use both for complete assessment

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
- Fatigue and weakness
- Cognitive impairment, brain fog
- Depression, irritability
- Pale skin (megaloblastic anemia)
- Mouth sores, sore tongue
- Shortness of breath
- Elevated homocysteine
- Peripheral neuropathy (if severe)

**Causes of Low Folate:**
- Inadequate dietary intake
- Malabsorption (celiac, Crohn's)
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Medications (methotrexate, some anti-seizure drugs)
- MTHFR gene variants (reduced conversion)
- Pregnancy and lactation (increased demand)
- Dialysis (removes folate)
- Poor gut health

**How to Raise Folate:**

**Dietary Sources (Best Absorbed):**
- Dark leafy greens: spinach, kale, collards
- Legumes: lentils, chickpeas, beans
- Asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts
- Avocado
- Citrus fruits
- Liver (highest natural source)
- Fortified grains and cereals

**Supplementation:**
- Folic acid: 400-800 mcg daily (synthetic form)
- Methylfolate (L-5-MTHF): 400-1,000 mcg daily (active form)
- Methylfolate preferred if MTHFR variant
- Take with B12 for optimal homocysteine reduction
- Folate + B6 + B12 combo most effective

**MTHFR Considerations:**
- ~40% of population has MTHFR variants
- Reduced ability to convert folic acid to active form
- Use methylfolate (already activated) if variant present
- Higher doses may be needed (1,000-5,000 mcg)

**When to Supplement:**
- Pregnancy/planning pregnancy: 400-800 mcg minimum
- Elevated homocysteine: 800-5,000 mcg
- MTHFR variants: Use methylfolate
- Alcohol use: 400-800 mcg
- On medications that deplete folate

**Special Considerations:**
- Always check B12 with folate (deficiencies often coexist)
- High folate can mask B12 deficiency
- Consider genetic testing for MTHFR variants
- Retest in 8-12 weeks after supplementation
- RBC folate better for long-term status""",
        'recommendations_primary': 'Eat dark leafy greens and legumes daily, consider methylfolate 400-1000mcg especially if MTHFR variant, pair with B12 supplementation',

    'Free Testosterone': {
        'education': """**Understanding Free Testosterone**

Free testosterone is the biologically active form of testosterone that is not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or albumin. It represents only 2-3% of total testosterone but is the form that actually enters cells to exert effects.

**The Longevity Connection:**
- Essential for muscle mass maintenance (prevents sarcopenia)
- Supports bone density (reduces fracture risk)
- Improves insulin sensitivity (metabolic health)
- Maintains cognitive function and mood
- Supports cardiovascular health in men
- Low levels associated with increased mortality in men
- Critical for sexual function and fertility

**Optimal Ranges:**

**Men:**
- Age 20-30: 100-225 pg/mL
- Age 30-40: 90-210 pg/mL
- Age 40-50: 85-200 pg/mL
- Age 50+: 75-190 pg/mL
- Optimal for longevity: Upper-mid range for age

**Women:**
- Pre-menopausal: 0.5-3.5 pg/mL
- Post-menopausal: 0.2-2.5 pg/mL
- Too high: PCOS, androgen excess

**Why Free Testosterone Matters More:**
- Total testosterone can be misleading if SHBG is abnormal
- High SHBG = normal total but low free testosterone
- Low SHBG = normal total but high free testosterone
- Free testosterone is what actually acts on tissues
- Better correlates with symptoms than total testosterone

**Symptoms of Low Free Testosterone (Men):**
- Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction
- Reduced muscle mass and strength
- Increased body fat (especially abdominal)
- Fatigue, low energy
- Depression, irritability
- Cognitive decline, poor concentration
- Decreased bone density

- Zinc: 15-30 mg daily if deficient
- Magnesium: 400-500 mg daily
- Ashwagandha: 600mg daily (shown to increase testosterone 14-18%)
- Tongkat Ali: 200-400mg daily
- DHEA: 25-50mg (men >40, women cautiously)
- Boron: 6-9mg daily

**When to Consider TRT (Men):**
- Free testosterone <50 pg/mL with symptoms
- No response to lifestyle interventions
- Documented hypogonadism on repeat tests
- Benefits: Improved energy, libido, muscle mass, bone density
- Risks: Fertility issues, prostate concerns, polycythemia
- Requires medical supervision

**Monitoring:**
- Check total testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG together
- Morning measurement (peaks in AM)
- Repeat if abnormal
- Monitor every 3-6 months if on TRT

**Special Considerations:**
- SHBG affects interpretation (high SHBG lowers free testosterone)
- Calculated free testosterone vs measured (calculated usually sufficient)
- Women: High free testosterone may indicate PCOS
- Always rule out secondary causes before TRT""",

- Regular exercise (improves RBC health)
- Hydration
- Avoid chronic stress

**When to Investigate:**
- RDW >15% warrants evaluation
- Trending upward over time
- Accompanied by anemia
- With symptoms of deficiency
- Check: CBC, iron panel, B12, folate, CRP

**Expected Timeline:**
- Nutritional corrections: 8-12 weeks to see improvement
- Iron repletion: 3-6 months
- Inflammation reduction: 3-6 months
- Recheck RDW every 3-6 months

**Clinical Significance:**
- Independent predictor of mortality (even if hemoglobin normal)
- Cardiovascular risk marker
- Inflammation indicator
- Early warning of nutritional deficiencies
- Predictor of heart failure decompensation

**Special Considerations:**
- High RDW with normal hemoglobin still significant
- Trend more important than single value
- May take months to normalize after treatment
- Consider comprehensive metabolic panel
- Check inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR)""",

    'Serum Ferritin': {
        'education': """**Understanding Serum Ferritin**

Serum ferritin is the primary storage form of iron in the body and the best single test for assessing iron status. It reflects total body iron stores and is crucial for energy production, oxygen transport, and numerous enzymatic processes.

**The Longevity Connection:**
- Essential for mitochondrial function and energy
- Critical for oxygen delivery to tissues
- Supports cognitive function and mood
- Important for exercise performance and recovery
- Both too low and too high associated with increased mortality
- Optimal iron status reduces fatigue and supports immune function
- Iron overload increases oxidative stress and disease risk

**Optimal Ranges:**

**Women (Pre-menopausal):**
- Optimal: 50-100 ng/mL
- Adequate: 30-50 ng/mL
- Low: 15-30 ng/mL (symptoms likely)
- Deficient: <15 ng/mL

**Women (Post-menopausal) and Men:**
- Optimal: 75-150 ng/mL
- Adequate: 50-75 ng/mL  
- Elevated: 200-300 ng/mL
- High: >300 ng/mL (investigate)

**Why Optimal Levels Matter:**
- <30 ng/mL: Fatigue, weakness, poor exercise tolerance
- 50-100 ng/mL: Optimal energy and performance
- >300 ng/mL: Iron overload risk (oxidative damage)

**Symptoms of Low Ferritin:**
- Persistent fatigue (most common)
- Weakness, low energy
- Brain fog, poor concentration
- Pale skin, brittle nails
- Hair loss or thinning
- Restless leg syndrome
- Cold hands and feet
- Shortness of breath with exertion
- Frequent infections
- Rapid heartbeat
- Headaches

**Causes of Low Ferritin:**
- Inadequate dietary intake
- Heavy menstrual bleeding
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Frequent blood donation
- GI bleeding (ulcers, polyps, cancer)
- Malabsorption (celiac, Crohn's, H. pylori)
- Intense exercise training
- Vegetarian/vegan diet without supplementation
- Chronic kidney disease (blood loss via dialysis)

**How to Raise Low Ferritin:**

**Dietary Sources:**
- Heme iron (best absorbed): red meat, organ meats, shellfish
- Non-heme iron: beans, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals
- Pair plant iron with vitamin C (citrus, tomatoes, peppers)
- Cast iron cookware
- Avoid iron blockers with iron-rich meals:
  - Calcium (dairy)
  - Tea and coffee (tannins)
  - Phytates (whole grains)

**Supplementation:**
- Elemental iron: 25-65mg daily
- Ferrous sulfate most common (20% elemental iron)
- Ferrous bisglycinate: Better tolerated, less GI upset
- Take on empty stomach with vitamin C
- Or with small meal if GI issues
- Separate from calcium and medications by 2+ hours

**Optimize Absorption:**
- Vitamin C: 500mg with iron
- Avoid antacids (reduce absorption)
- Take iron at bedtime (may reduce nausea)
- Don't take with dairy, tea, coffee, or calcium

**Monitor Progress:**
- Recheck ferritin in 8-12 weeks
- Should increase 10-20 ng/mL monthly with supplementation
- Continue 3-6 months after normalization
- May take 6-12 months to fully replete

**Causes of High Ferritin:**
- Hemochromatosis (genetic iron overload)
- Chronic inflammation (ferritin is acute phase reactant)
- Liver disease
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Metabolic syndrome
- Cancer
- Multiple blood transfusions
- Excessive iron supplementation

**If Ferritin Elevated:**
- Check CRP (if elevated, ferritin may be inflammatory)
- Check transferrin saturation (>45% suggests iron overload)
- Genetic testing for hemochromatosis (C282Y, H63D)
- Reduce/stop iron supplements
- Consider therapeutic phlebotomy if true overload
- Address underlying inflammation
- Limit red meat and iron-fortified foods

**Special Considerations:**
- Ferritin is an acute phase reactant (elevated with inflammation)
- If CRP elevated, ferritin may not reflect true iron stores
- Check iron saturation and TIBC with ferritin
- Athletes may need higher levels (>50 ng/mL) for performance
- Vegetarians/vegans often need supplementation
- Heavy periods: Often need ongoing supplementation""",
        'recommendations_primary': 'Consume heme iron from red meat and shellfish, pair plant iron with vitamin C, cook with cast iron, avoid tea/coffee with iron-rich meals',
        'therapeutics_primary': 'Ferrous bisglycinate 25-65mg elemental iron daily with 500mg vitamin C; continue 3-6 months after ferritin normalizes to replete stores'

    'Serum Protein': {
        'education': """**Understanding Total Serum Protein**

Total serum protein measures all proteins in blood, primarily albumin and globulins. It reflects nutritional status, liver and kidney function, and immune system health.

**The Longevity Connection:**
- Adequate protein critical for muscle mass (prevents sarcopenia)
- Supports immune function
- Low protein associated with frailty and mortality
- High protein may indicate chronic inflammation or disease
- Optimal levels support healthy aging

**Optimal Ranges:**
- Optimal: 6.8-7.5 g/dL
- Normal: 6.0-8.3 g/dL
- Low: <6.0 g/dL
- High: >8.3 g/dL

**Components:**
- Albumin: 60-70% of total protein
- Globulins: 30-40% of total protein
  - Alpha-1, Alpha-2 globulins
  - Beta globulins  
  - Gamma globulins (immunoglobulins/antibodies)

**Why It Matters:**
- Nutritional status indicator
- Liver synthetic function
- Kidney function (protein loss)
- Immune system health
- Hydration status
- Chronic disease marker

**Causes of Low Total Protein:**

**Nutritional:**
- Inadequate protein intake
- Malabsorption (celiac, Crohn's)
- Severe malnutrition
- Eating disorders

**Liver Disease:**
- Cirrhosis (decreased production)
- Hepatitis
- Liver failure

**Kidney Disease:**
- Nephrotic syndrome (protein loss in urine)
- Chronic kidney disease
- Glomerulonephritis

**Other Causes:**
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Chronic infections
- Burns (protein loss)
- Hemorrhage
- Pregnancy
- Overhydration (dilution)

**Causes of High Total Protein:**
- Dehydration (most common)
- Multiple myeloma
- Chronic inflammation
- Waldenström macroglobulinemia
- HIV infection
- Hepatitis B or C
- Autoimmune diseases

**How to Optimize Serum Protein:**

**If Low (Nutritional):**
- Increase protein intake: 0.8-1.2 g/kg body weight
- High-quality sources: eggs, fish, poultry, lean meats
- Plant proteins: legumes, quinoa, tofu
- Protein at each meal (20-30g)
- Digestive enzymes if malabsorption
- Address underlying GI issues

**Protein-Rich Foods:**
- Animal sources (complete proteins): chicken, fish, eggs, dairy
- Plant sources: beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, whole grains
- Protein shakes/powders if needed
- Greek yogurt, cottage cheese
- Collagen peptides

**If High (Investigation Needed):**
- Check hydration status
- Protein electrophoresis (SPEP)
- Rule out multiple myeloma
- Check for chronic infections
- Evaluate for autoimmune disease

**Diagnostic Steps:**
- Check albumin and globulin levels separately
- Calculate A/G ratio (albumin/globulin)
- Normal A/G ratio: 1.0-2.5
- Low A/G: Increased globulins (inflammation, myeloma)
- High A/G: Decreased globulins (immune deficiency)

**Associated Tests:**
- Albumin (synthetic liver function)
- Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
- Kidney function (creatinine, eGFR, urine protein)
- Protein electrophoresis if abnormal pattern
- CRP (inflammation)

**Expected Timeline:**
- Nutritional improvement: 4-8 weeks
- Liver disease: Variable depending on severity
- Kidney disease: May not normalize without treatment

**Special Considerations:**
- Dehydration is most common cause of elevated levels
- Multiple myeloma presents with very high protein
- Low albumin more concerning than low total protein alone
- Check urine protein if serum protein low
- Trend over time important""",
        'recommendations_primary': 'Ensure adequate protein intake 0.8-1.2g/kg daily from high-quality sources (eggs, fish, poultry, legumes), address malabsorption if present',
        'therapeutics_primary': 'Protein supplementation 20-40g daily if dietary intake inadequate; digestive enzymes if malabsorption; address underlying liver/kidney disease'
    },

    'SHBG': {
        'education': """**Understanding SHBG (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin)**

SHBG is a protein that binds to testosterone and estrogen, controlling how much of these hormones are available to tissues. Only "free" hormones (not bound to SHBG) are biologically active.

**The Longevity Connection:**
- Regulates bioavailable sex hormones
- Low SHBG associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes
- High SHBG may indicate low bioavailable testosterone
- Affects muscle mass, bone density, and body composition
- Influences cardiovascular health
- Marker of metabolic and thyroid health

**Optimal Ranges:**

**Men:**
- Optimal: 20-50 nmol/L
- Low: <20 nmol/L (more free testosterone)
- High: >50 nmol/L (less free testosterone)

**Women:**
- Pre-menopausal: 20-100 nmol/L
- Post-menopausal: 15-60 nmol/L
- High: >100 nmol/L
- Low: <20 nmol/L (may indicate PCOS)

**What SHBG Tells You:**
- Low SHBG = More free (active) testosterone and estrogen
- High SHBG = Less free (active) testosterone and estrogen
- Helps interpret total testosterone levels
- Marker of metabolic health

**Causes of Low SHBG:**

**Metabolic Issues (Most Common):**
- Insulin resistance and diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome
- Obesity (especially visceral fat)
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women

**Hormonal:**
- Hypothyroidism
- Growth hormone excess
- Androgenic steroids
- Insulin or IGF-1 excess

**Lifestyle:**
- High refined carbohydrate diet
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Poor sleep

**Medications:**
- Androgens
- Glucocorticoids
- Progestins
- Growth hormone

**Causes of High SHBG:**

**Hormonal:**
- Hyperthyroidism
- Estrogen excess
- Low testosterone (aging in men)
- Anorexia nervosa

**Liver:**
- Cirrhosis
- Hepatitis  
- Liver disease

**Medications:**
- Estrogen (birth control, HRT)
- Some antiepileptics
- Thyroxine

**Other:**
- Aging
- Pregnancy
- Genetics
- Excessive exercise
- Very low body fat

**How to Optimize SHBG:**

**If Low SHBG (Metabolic Syndrome):**

**Improve Insulin Sensitivity:**
- Weight loss (especially visceral fat)
- Low glycemic diet
- Reduce refined carbs and sugar
- Increase fiber intake
- Strength training 3-4x weekly
- High-intensity interval training

**Dietary Interventions:**
- Mediterranean diet
- High fiber (30-40g daily)
- Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, avocado, fatty fish)
- Limit processed foods
- Reduce sugar and refined carbs
- Adequate protein

**Supplements:**
- Fiber supplements (psyllium, glucomannan)
- Berberine: 500mg 3x daily
- Inositol: 2-4g daily (especially for PCOS)
- Omega-3: 2-4g daily
- Magnesium: 400-500mg daily
- Vitamin D: Optimize to >40 ng/mL

**Lifestyle:**
- Exercise regularly (muscle building increases SHBG)
- Lose excess weight
- Improve sleep quality
- Reduce stress
- Avoid alcohol

**If High SHBG (Low Free Hormones):**

**Address Underlying Causes:**
- Check thyroid function (treat hyperthyroidism)
- Evaluate liver function
- Consider hormone replacement if deficient
- Review medications
- Assess nutritional status

**For Men with High SHBG:**
- May have normal total testosterone but low free testosterone
- Symptoms: Low libido, fatigue, erectile dysfunction
- Consider free or bioavailable testosterone testing
- TRT may be needed even with normal total testosterone
- Boron supplementation: 6-9mg daily (may lower SHBG)

**For Women with High SHBG:**
- May have low bioavailable androgens
- Symptoms: Low libido, fatigue, depression
- Common with birth control pills
- May improve off hormonal contraception

**Monitoring:**
- Recheck in 3-6 months after interventions
- Check with total and free testosterone
- Monitor metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, lipids)
- Track symptoms

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- Low SHBG + Normal total testosterone = High free testosterone
- High SHBG + Normal total testosterone = Low free testosterone
- Always interpret with full hormone panel
- Calculate free testosterone for accurate assessment

**Special Considerations:**
- SHBG more useful than total testosterone alone
- Varies with thyroid status
- Strongly affected by insulin levels
- Birth control pills raise SHBG significantly
- Aging increases SHBG in men (decreases free testosterone)""",
        'recommendations_primary': 'If low: lose excess weight, low-carb Mediterranean diet, strength training 3-4x weekly; if high: check thyroid, consider boron 6-9mg daily',
