"""
Education Score Component

Calculates the education score for each pillar based on patient engagement
with educational articles.

Scoring Logic:
- Each pillar has 4 core articles
- Each article viewed = 2.5 points (2.5% of total pillar score)
- Maximum education score per pillar = 10 points (10% of total pillar score)
- Combined with Survey (variable) + Biomarkers (variable) = 100% total

Requirements for "viewed":
- Time spent >= min_engagement_seconds (default 30s) OR
- Scroll percentage >= 80%
