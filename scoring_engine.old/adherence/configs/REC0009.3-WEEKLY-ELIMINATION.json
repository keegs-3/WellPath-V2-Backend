    "overview": "Added sugar contributes to metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and increased chronic disease risk. Reducing daily added sugar improves energy, supports healthy weight, and protects long-term cardiometabolic health. For this recommendation, a serving is any food or drink with about 8\u201312g of added sugar (e.g., 1 cookie, sweetened yogurt, granola bar, or can of soda). If the item is over 15g, count as 2 servings."
