('recgGEypX3ghJay5R',
'What Is Healthful Nutrition?
Healthful nutrition is your body''s foundation, providing fuel, building blocks, and protective compounds that influence every physiological system. This pillar measures how well your dietary choices support metabolic health, reduce inflammation, and optimize cellular function for longevity.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Healthful Nutrition score combines three components:
• Biomarkers (72%): Laboratory values like HbA1c, lipid panels, and inflammatory markers
• Behaviors (18%): Dietary patterns, food quality, and eating habits
• Education (10%): Completion of nutrition learning modules

Why This Weighting?
With 67 available biomarkers, nutrition offers the most comprehensive objective measurement of any health pillar. Your blood work tells a clear, measurable story about nutritional status. HbA1c reveals glucose control, lipid panels show cardiovascular risk, and inflammatory markers indicate chronic disease progression.

The heavy biomarker emphasis reflects scientific reality: laboratory values provide direct evidence of how dietary choices affect metabolic health. Behavioral assessment captures the patterns driving those outcomes, while education ensures you understand the science behind nutritional recommendations.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Nutritional choices directly impact:
• Metabolic health and diabetes prevention
• Cardiovascular disease risk
• Chronic inflammation and aging
• Cellular energy production and repair
• Microbiome diversity and gut health
• Cognitive function and neuroprotection

Optimizing nutrition isn''t about perfection, it''s about consistent patterns that support healthy aging across decades.');

-- 2. MOVEMENT + EXERCISE
INSERT INTO public.wellpath_pillars_about (pillar_id, about_content) VALUES
('recp0marLNu65GGhd',
'What Is Movement + Exercise?
Movement and exercise represent powerful interventions that influence virtually every system in your body. This pillar measures your capacity for physical activity, from daily movement patterns to structured exercise, and assesses how these behaviors manifest in measurable fitness and metabolic markers.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Movement + Exercise score combines:
• Biomarkers (54%): Cardiovascular markers, metabolic health, body composition proxies
• Behaviors (36%): Activity patterns, exercise frequency, movement quality
• Education (10%): Completion of exercise learning modules

Why This Weighting?
Movement creates a balanced objective-subjective measurement need. While 32 biomarkers track fitness consequences (lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, inflammatory status), your actual activity patterns require behavioral assessment. The 54/36 split acknowledges that both what you do (behaviors) and what results you achieve (biomarkers) matter equally for longevity outcomes.

Blood tests reveal cardiovascular fitness impacts, but they can''t measure whether you''re actually moving. Conversely, self-reported activity doesn''t guarantee metabolic benefits. This balanced approach ensures both action and outcome are properly weighted.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Regular movement affects:
• Cardiovascular health and mortality risk
• Metabolic function and glucose control
• Muscle mass preservation (sarcopenia prevention)
• Bone density and fracture risk
• Cognitive function and neuroplasticity
• Mental health and mood regulation
• Immune system function

Exercise is arguably the single most potent longevity intervention available, influencing lifespan and healthspan more than most medical treatments.');

-- 3. RESTORATIVE SLEEP
INSERT INTO public.wellpath_pillars_about (pillar_id, about_content) VALUES
('rec6QXhDyyqwyuLdd',
'What Is Restorative Sleep?
Restorative sleep is your body''s essential recovery and repair period. This pillar measures sleep quality, duration, and consistency, along with the metabolic and inflammatory consequences that poor sleep creates in your physiology.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Restorative Sleep score combines:
• Biomarkers (63%): Metabolic markers, inflammatory status, micronutrient levels affected by sleep
• Behaviors (27%): Sleep duration, quality, consistency, and sleep hygiene practices
• Education (10%): Completion of sleep learning modules

Why This Weighting?
Sleep quality strongly correlates with measurable physiological markers. Poor sleep elevates inflammatory markers (hsCRP), disrupts glucose metabolism (HbA1c), depletes critical micronutrients (magnesium, vitamin D), and affects iron metabolism. With 25 biomarkers tracking these sleep-related impacts, the 63% biomarker weighting reflects how profoundly sleep dysfunction appears in your blood work.

Behavioral assessment remains important for capturing sleep patterns, duration, and habits that lab values can''t measure, but the physiological consequences of poor sleep are remarkably visible in objective testing.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Sleep quality impacts:
• Metabolic health and diabetes risk
• Cardiovascular disease and hypertension
• Immune system function
• Cognitive performance and dementia risk
• Inflammatory status and chronic disease
• Hormonal balance and stress response
• Cellular repair and detoxification

Chronic sleep deprivation accelerates biological aging and increases mortality risk across nearly every major disease category.');

-- 4. STRESS MANAGEMENT
INSERT INTO public.wellpath_pillars_about (pillar_id, about_content) VALUES
('reclbVFCBWmPyvvhP',
'What Is Stress Management?
Stress management encompasses your ability to regulate stress responses, maintain emotional equilibrium, and prevent chronic stress from damaging your physiology. This pillar measures both subjective stress experience and the inflammatory and hormonal consequences of chronic stress activation.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Stress Management score combines:
• Biomarkers (27%): Stress hormones, inflammatory markers, metabolic stress indicators
• Behaviors (63%): Perceived stress levels, coping strategies, stress triggers, resilience practices
• Education (10%): Completion of stress management learning modules

Why This Weighting?
Stress is primarily a subjective experience that demands behavioral emphasis (63%). How you perceive and respond to stressors matters more than external circumstances. Your self-assessment captures stress intensity, frequency, and coping effectiveness that no blood test can measure.

However, chronic stress does leave measurable physiological signatures. With 35 biomarkers tracking stress consequences (cortisol, inflammatory markers, immune function), the 27% biomarker weighting acknowledges that persistent stress eventually appears in lab values. The challenge is that biomarkers lag behind perception, they show long-term damage rather than current stress levels.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Chronic stress impacts:
• Cardiovascular disease and hypertension
• Immune system suppression
• Metabolic dysfunction and weight gain
• Inflammatory status and chronic disease
• Sleep quality and recovery
• Cognitive function and mental health
• Accelerated cellular aging (telomere shortening)

Stress isn''t just uncomfortable, it''s directly toxic to longevity when chronic and unmanaged.');

-- 5. COGNITIVE HEALTH
INSERT INTO public.wellpath_pillars_about (pillar_id, about_content) VALUES
('recIdXMUiA9tWGVL8',
'What Is Cognitive Health?
Cognitive health encompasses brain function, mental clarity, memory, and the neurological resilience that maintains cognitive capacity throughout life. This pillar measures both subjective cognitive experience and the vascular and metabolic markers that support brain health.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Cognitive Health score combines:
• Biomarkers (36%): Vascular health markers, metabolic function, micronutrients supporting brain health
• Behaviors (54%): Self-assessed cognitive function, mental stimulation, brain-healthy habits
• Education (10%): Completion of cognitive health learning modules

Why This Weighting?
Cognitive function requires heavy behavioral emphasis (54%) because subjective experience matters enormously. You notice brain fog, memory issues, and mental clarity changes long before they appear in blood tests. However, 25 biomarkers do predict cognitive trajectory: vascular markers (LDL, ApoB, Lp(a)) affect brain blood flow, metabolic markers (HbA1c, glucose, insulin) influence neurodegeneration risk, and micronutrients (Omega-3, magnesium) support brain function.

The 36% biomarker weighting reflects that these markers are mostly proxies for brain health rather than direct cognitive measures. They predict risk but don''t capture current cognitive performance.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Cognitive preservation affects:
• Independence and quality of life in later years
• Dementia and Alzheimer''s risk
• Mental health and emotional regulation
• Social connection and relationship quality
• Occupational performance and engagement
• Learning capacity and adaptability

Maintaining cognitive function isn''t just about preventing decline, it''s about sustaining the mental capacity that makes life meaningful and engaging.');

-- 6. CONNECTION + PURPOSE
INSERT INTO public.wellpath_pillars_about (pillar_id, about_content) VALUES
('recWHZ0F3RQskqHtH',
'What Is Connection + Purpose?
Connection and purpose encompass the social relationships, community engagement, and sense of meaning that make life worth living. This pillar measures relationship quality, social integration, and the psychological well-being that comes from purposeful living.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Connection + Purpose score combines:
• Biomarkers (18%): Inflammatory and stress markers (indirect indicators only)
• Behaviors (72%): Relationship quality, social engagement, sense of purpose, community connection
• Education (10%): Completion of connection and purpose learning modules

Why This Weighting?
Social connection quality cannot be measured through blood work. The 18% biomarker component uses only 4 markers (hsCRP, cortisol, DHEA-S) that indirectly reflect social isolation''s physiological consequences, not connection quality itself. These markers measure chronic stress and inflammation that can result from loneliness, but they don''t capture the positive aspects of social connection.

The 72% behavioral weighting reflects reality: assessing relationship quality, social support, community engagement, and sense of purpose requires self-report. This is one pillar where subjective assessment isn''t a limitation, it''s the only valid measurement approach.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Social connection impacts:
• All-cause mortality (isolation equals smoking 15 cigarettes daily)
• Cardiovascular disease risk
• Immune system function
• Cognitive decline and dementia risk
• Mental health and depression
• Stress resilience and coping capacity
• Healthy behavior adoption and maintenance

Connection isn''t a "nice to have" for longevity, it''s as critical as nutrition and exercise for lifespan and healthspan outcomes.');

-- 7. CORE CARE
INSERT INTO public.wellpath_pillars_about (pillar_id, about_content) VALUES
('recOT0nP41iwVDLKR',
'What Is Core Care?
Core Care encompasses the foundational preventive healthcare practices that catch problems early and maintain baseline health. This pillar measures screening completion, preventive care engagement, and the basic health maintenance that prevents small issues from becoming major diseases.

How This Pillar Is Scored
Your Core Care score combines:
• Biomarkers (49.5%): Foundational preventive health markers, cardiovascular risk, basic inflammatory markers
• Behaviors (40.5%): Screening completion, preventive care visits, health monitoring habits
• Education (10%): Completion of preventive care learning modules

Why This Weighting?
Core Care requires near-equal emphasis on both objective measures and behavioral engagement. With 23 biomarkers tracking foundational health (metabolic panels, cardiovascular markers, screening-related values), the 49.5% biomarker weighting captures your baseline physiological status.

However, preventive care is fundamentally about actions taken: scheduling screenings, attending appointments, monitoring health metrics, and catching problems early. The 40.5% behavioral component ensures that engagement with healthcare system receives proper emphasis. This balanced 50/50 split acknowledges that both baseline health status and proactive care-seeking behavior matter equally.

Why This Matters for Longevity
Preventive care impacts:
• Early disease detection and treatment
• Cancer screening and survival rates
• Cardiovascular event prevention
• Chronic disease management
• Baseline health monitoring
• Healthcare system navigation
• Proactive rather than reactive health management

Core Care isn''t glamorous, but it''s the foundation that catches treatable problems before they become life-threatening diseases.');
