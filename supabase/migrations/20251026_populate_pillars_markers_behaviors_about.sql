'What We Measure
Your biomarker score reflects the measurable metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory consequences of your nutritional choices. These objective laboratory values validate whether your dietary patterns support optimal longevity or accelerate disease risk.

Categories of Markers

Metabolic Health (Primary Focus)
• HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin track glucose regulation and diabetes risk
• These markers reveal how well your body processes carbohydrates and maintains stable blood sugar
• Elevated values indicate insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, and accelerated aging

Cardiovascular Risk (Primary Focus)
• Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, ApoB, Lp(a) assess heart disease risk
• Lipid panels show how dietary fats affect arterial health and cardiovascular function
• Optimal ratios protect against atherosclerosis and cardiac events

Inflammatory Status (Secondary)
• hsCRP and white blood cell counts measure chronic inflammation
• Persistent inflammation drives multiple age-related diseases
• Dietary choices strongly influence inflammatory markers

Micronutrients (Secondary)
• Omega-3 index, vitamin D, magnesium, iron markers track nutritional adequacy
• Deficiencies undermine multiple physiological systems
• Optimal levels support cellular function and disease prevention

Why 72% Weighting?
With 67 available biomarkers, nutrition offers the most comprehensive objective measurement capability of any health pillar. Your blood work provides direct, measurable evidence of how dietary choices affect your body at the cellular and systemic level.

Unlike subjective reports of eating habits, laboratory values can''t be misremembered or rationalized. They represent biological truth about nutritional status. This extensive measurement capability justifies the heavy biomarker emphasis.

What Improvement Looks Like
Targeted nutritional interventions produce measurable results:
• Reducing added sugars improves HbA1c within 3 months
• Increasing soluble fiber lowers LDL cholesterol within 6-8 weeks
• Anti-inflammatory foods reduce hsCRP over 2-3 months
• Omega-3 supplementation raises omega-3 index within 4-6 months

Your biomarker score directly translates dietary changes into quantifiable health improvements.',

'What We Measure
Your behavioral score captures the daily dietary choices, eating patterns, and nutritional habits that drive your biomarker results. While lab values show outcomes, behaviors reveal the actions creating those outcomes.

Categories of Behaviors

Dietary Patterns (Primary Focus)
• Whole food consumption vs. processed food intake
• Meal timing, eating frequency, and circadian alignment
• Plant diversity and phytonutrient variety
• Home cooking vs. restaurant/prepared meals

Food Quality (Primary Focus)
• Fruit and vegetable intake (servings and variety)
• Fiber consumption (soluble and insoluble sources)
• Protein sources (quality, quantity, distribution)
• Fat quality (omega-3, monounsaturated, saturated ratios)

Nutritional Habits (Secondary)
• Meal planning and preparation practices
• Mindful eating and portion awareness
• Reading nutrition labels and ingredient lists
• Food sourcing and quality standards

Substance Management (Secondary)
• Alcohol consumption (frequency and quantity)
• Added sugar intake (hidden and obvious sources)
• Sodium levels (processed vs. whole food sources)
• Caffeine timing and impact on sleep

Why 18% Weighting?
While nutrition''s heavy biomarker emphasis (72%) provides objective validation, the 18% behavioral component captures the human element, your actual choices, barriers, and patterns. Biomarkers show results, but behaviors show process.

This modest weighting acknowledges that in nutrition, outcomes matter more than self-reported actions. Someone can claim perfect eating habits while biomarkers reveal metabolic dysfunction. Conversely, biomarkers don''t explain why someone struggles with dietary adherence or what barriers prevent improvement.

What Improvement Looks Like
Behavioral changes precede biomarker improvements:
• Increasing vegetable servings from 2 to 5 daily
• Replacing processed snacks with whole food alternatives
• Establishing consistent meal timing (12-hour eating window)
• Reducing alcohol from daily to 2-3 times weekly
• Cooking at home 5+ nights per week vs. 2-3

Your behavioral score tracks the actions that will eventually manifest as improved biomarkers, providing early validation of positive changes before lab values update.',

'What We Measure
Your biomarker score reflects the cardiovascular, metabolic, and physiological adaptations that result from regular physical activity. These objective measures validate whether your movement patterns produce actual fitness improvements and health benefits.

Categories of Markers

Cardiovascular Health (Primary Focus)
• Lipid panels (cholesterol, triglycerides) show cardiovascular fitness
• Blood pressure and resting heart rate indicate cardiac efficiency
• Inflammatory markers (hsCRP) reflect cardiovascular disease risk
• Exercise improves all these markers independent of weight loss

Metabolic Function (Primary Focus)
• HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin track metabolic health
• Regular movement enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake
• Even without weight loss, exercise improves metabolic markers

Body Composition Proxies (Secondary)
• While we don''t directly measure body fat percentage, certain markers hint at composition
• Muscle mass affects metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity
• Body composition changes often precede scale weight changes

Recovery and Adaptation Markers (Secondary)
• Iron markers, magnesium, vitamin D support exercise recovery
• Inflammatory markers show whether training load is appropriate
• These markers help optimize training intensity and recovery

Why 54% Weighting?
With 32 biomarkers tracking movement consequences, the 54% biomarker emphasis reflects that exercise creates measurable physiological changes. Your blood work validates that activity patterns produce actual fitness benefits, not just subjective feelings of improvement.

However, biomarkers can''t measure actual movement patterns, exercise frequency, or activity quality. Someone could have good metabolic markers from genetics or diet but still be sedentary. The balanced 54/36 split ensures both outcomes (biomarkers) and actions (behaviors) receive appropriate emphasis.

What Improvement Looks Like
Consistent exercise produces measurable changes:
• Triglycerides decrease by 20-30% with regular cardio
• HDL cholesterol increases with sustained aerobic activity
• Fasting glucose improves with strength training
• hsCRP decreases with moderate regular activity
• These changes often appear within 8-12 weeks of consistent training

Your biomarker score quantifies whether your movement practice actually improves cardiovascular and metabolic health.',

'What We Measure
Your behavioral score captures the actual movement patterns, exercise habits, and activity choices that should produce biomarker improvements. This component tracks what you do, not just what results you achieve.

Categories of Behaviors

Structured Exercise (Primary Focus)
• Resistance training frequency and progressive overload
• Cardiovascular exercise (zone 2, HIIT, mixed modalities)
• Exercise consistency and weekly volume
• Training periodization and progression

Daily Movement Patterns (Primary Focus)
• Steps per day and non-exercise activity
• Sedentary time and break frequency
• Incidental movement and activity integration
• Movement quality and functional patterns

Movement Quality (Secondary)
• Mobility and flexibility practices
• Balance and coordination work
• Movement variety and skill development
• Injury prevention and body awareness

Recovery Practices (Secondary)
• Rest day implementation and active recovery
• Sleep quality around training
• Nutrition timing for performance
• Stress management and training load balance

Why 36% Weighting?
Movement requires substantial behavioral assessment (36%) because biomarkers can''t capture whether you''re actually exercising. Someone could have poor metabolic markers despite regular training (diet issues), or good markers despite being sedentary (genetic luck, dietary factors).

The 36% behavioral emphasis ensures that actual activity patterns receive credit even when biomarkers lag behind (common in early training stages) or when genetic factors mask exercise benefits in lab values.

What Improvement Looks Like
Behavioral progress shows up before biomarker changes:
• Increasing weekly resistance training from 0 to 2-3 sessions
• Building cardio consistency from sporadic to 3-5x weekly
• Growing daily steps from 3,000 to 8,000+
• Reducing sedentary blocks from 4+ hours to sub-2 hours
• Adding mobility work 3x weekly

Your behavioral score validates training commitment and provides motivation during the 6-12 week lag before biomarkers reflect your efforts.',

'What We Measure
Your biomarker score reflects the metabolic, inflammatory, and micronutrient consequences of sleep quality and duration. Poor sleep leaves distinct physiological signatures that appear in laboratory values long before subjective impact feels severe.

Categories of Markers

Metabolic Disruption (Primary Focus)
• HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin show glucose dysregulation from poor sleep
• Sleep deprivation impairs insulin sensitivity independent of diet
• Even one night of poor sleep affects glucose metabolism measurably
• Chronic sleep loss creates prediabetic metabolic patterns

Inflammatory Status (Primary Focus)
• hsCRP, white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio track inflammation
• Sleep deprivation activates inflammatory pathways
• Poor sleep quality elevates inflammatory markers within days
• Inflammation from sleep loss accelerates cardiovascular disease and aging

Micronutrient Markers (Secondary)
• Magnesium (RBC), vitamin D, iron markers (ferritin, TIBC, transferrin saturation)
• Sleep quality both depends on and affects micronutrient status
• Deficiencies impair sleep quality in feedback loops
• RDW (red blood cell distribution width) reflects chronic inflammation from sleep issues

Stress and Recovery Markers (Secondary)
• Cortisol rhythms (when measured) show circadian disruption
• DHEA-S reflects stress hormone balance
• Sleep is when hormonal rhythms reset and normalize

Why 63% Weighting?
Sleep quality strongly correlates with measurable physiological dysfunction. With 25 biomarkers tracking sleep-related metabolic, inflammatory, and micronutrient impacts, the 63% biomarker weighting reflects how profoundly sleep problems manifest in blood work.

Unlike many health domains where biomarkers lag far behind subjective experience, sleep dysfunction appears remarkably quickly in lab values. Poor sleep creates measurable metabolic and inflammatory changes within days to weeks.

What Improvement Looks Like
Sleep optimization produces measurable benefits:
• HbA1c decreases 0.2-0.4% with sleep improvement (7 to 8 hours nightly)
• hsCRP drops significantly when sleep quality improves
• Fasting glucose stabilizes with consistent sleep duration
• Micronutrient markers normalize as sleep-dependent absorption improves

Your biomarker score quantifies whether sleep improvements produce actual physiological recovery and metabolic health benefits.',

'What We Measure
Your behavioral score captures sleep patterns, quality perceptions, and sleep hygiene practices that drive biomarker outcomes. This component tracks both objective sleep metrics (when available) and subjective sleep experience.

Categories of Behaviors

Sleep Quantity and Consistency (Primary Focus)
• Sleep duration (targeting 7-9 hours for most adults)
• Bedtime and wake time consistency (including weekends)
• Sleep schedule variability and social jetlag
• Total time in bed vs. actual sleep time

Sleep Quality Perception (Primary Focus)
• Subjective sleep quality and restfulness upon waking
• Sleep onset latency (time to fall asleep)
• Number of awakenings and ease of returning to sleep
• Morning energy levels and daytime sleepiness

Sleep Hygiene Practices (Secondary)
• Evening routines and wind-down practices
• Bedroom environment (temperature, darkness, noise control)
• Blue light exposure and screen time before bed
• Caffeine and alcohol timing relative to bedtime

Circadian Alignment (Secondary)
• Light exposure timing (morning sunlight, evening darkness)
• Meal timing relative to sleep
• Exercise timing and impact on sleep
• Nap practices and circadian rhythm support

Why 27% Weighting?
While sleep''s heavy biomarker emphasis (63%) captures physiological consequences, the 27% behavioral component remains essential. Biomarkers show that sleep is problematic but can''t explain why someone struggles with sleep or what barriers prevent improvement.

Subjective sleep quality, sleep onset difficulty, and awakening frequency require self-report. These experiences matter for understanding sleep problems even when biomarkers haven''t yet deteriorated or when someone has resilient physiology that masks poor sleep in lab values temporarily.

What Improvement Looks Like
Behavioral improvements often precede biomarker changes:
• Extending sleep from 6 to 7.5 hours nightly
• Improving bedtime consistency (within 30-minute window)
• Reducing sleep onset latency from 45 to 15 minutes
• Decreasing middle-of-night awakenings from 3-4 to 0-1
• Establishing evening wind-down routine (no screens 90 minutes before bed)

Your behavioral score tracks sleep habit improvements that will eventually manifest as better biomarkers, providing early validation before lab values update.',

'What We Measure
Your biomarker score reflects vascular health, metabolic function, and micronutrient status that predict long-term cognitive trajectory. These markers don''t measure current cognitive performance, they measure brain health infrastructure and dementia risk factors.

Categories of Markers

Vascular Health (Primary Focus)
• LDL cholesterol, ApoB, Lp(a) predict vascular dementia risk
• Brain requires robust blood flow; vascular disease impairs cognitive function
• High LDL in midlife predicts dementia decades later
• Optimal vascular markers protect brain blood supply

Metabolic Health (Primary Focus)
• HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin affect neurodegeneration risk
• Type 2 diabetes doubles dementia risk independent of vascular factors
• Insulin resistance impairs brain glucose metabolism and cognition
• Optimal metabolic health protects against cognitive decline

Micronutrients for Brain Function (Secondary)
• Omega-3 index (DHA critical for brain structure and function)
• Magnesium (RBC) (supports neurotransmitter function and neuroplasticity)
• Vitamin B12, folate (when measured) protect against brain atrophy
• Optimal micronutrient status supports cognitive performance

Inflammatory Markers (Secondary)
• hsCRP, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio track neuroinflammation risk
• Chronic systemic inflammation promotes cognitive decline
• Inflammatory pathways accelerate Alzheimer''s pathology
• Lower inflammation preserves cognitive function with aging

Why 36% Weighting?
Cognitive health uses modest biomarker weighting (36%) because these 25 markers are mostly proxies for brain health rather than direct cognitive measures. They predict risk decades in advance but don''t capture current cognitive performance, memory, or mental clarity.

Vascular and metabolic markers show what increases dementia risk, not whether you''re experiencing brain fog today. The 36% weighting acknowledges these markers matter for long-term trajectory while recognizing they don''t measure actual cognitive function.

What Improvement Looks Like
Optimizing cognitive biomarkers reduces long-term dementia risk:
• Lowering LDL from 130 to 100 mg/dL reduces vascular dementia risk
• Improving HbA1c from 5.8% to 5.2% protects brain glucose metabolism
• Raising omega-3 index from 4% to 8%+ supports brain structure
• Reducing hsCRP decreases neuroinflammation and cognitive decline risk

Your biomarker score quantifies whether you''re building brain health infrastructure for decades ahead, even if cognitive performance feels fine today.',

Your behavioral score captures subjective cognitive experience, mental stimulation practices, and brain-healthy habits. This component measures current cognitive function and the activities that maintain cognitive capacity.

Categories of Behaviors

Cognitive Performance (Primary Focus)
• Memory function (short-term and long-term recall)
• Mental clarity and brain fog frequency
• Focus and concentration capacity
• Processing speed and decision-making quality
• Word finding and language fluency

Mental Stimulation (Primary Focus)
• Learning new skills and cognitive challenges
• Reading, puzzles, and mentally engaging activities
• Social interaction and conversation complexity
• Novel experiences and cognitive flexibility
• Work complexity and intellectual engagement

Brain-Healthy Habits (Secondary)
• Sleep quality and cognitive recovery
• Stress management and cortisol regulation
• Physical exercise (strongest cognitive protection)
• Social connection (cognitive stimulation and resilience)
• Substance use (alcohol, cannabis affecting cognition)

Cognitive Load Management (Secondary)
• Multitasking vs. focused attention
• Digital device use and attention fragmentation
• Mental rest and cognitive recovery practices
• Stress reduction and cognitive bandwidth preservation

Why 54% Weighting?
Cognitive health requires heavy behavioral emphasis (54%) because subjective experience is what actually matters. You notice memory problems, brain fog, and mental clarity changes immediately, long before any biomarker shows dysfunction.

Self-reported cognitive function predicts dementia risk as reliably as many objective tests. How you perceive your cognition matters both for quality of life today and as an early warning system for decline. The 54% behavioral weighting ensures your lived cognitive experience receives proper emphasis.

What Improvement Looks Like
Cognitive behavioral improvements are immediately noticeable:
• Reducing brain fog episodes from daily to rare
• Improving focus duration from 20 minutes to 90+ minutes
• Enhancing memory recall and reducing "tip of tongue" moments
• Increasing mental clarity and decision-making confidence
• Expanding cognitive engagement through learning and novel activities

Your biomarker score reflects the physiological consequences of chronic stress activation. While stress is primarily a subjective experience, persistent stress creates measurable inflammatory, hormonal, and metabolic changes that appear in laboratory values.

Categories of Markers

Stress Hormones (Primary Focus)
• Cortisol (when measured) reveals stress hormone dysregulation
• DHEA-S reflects stress resilience and hormonal balance
• Chronic stress depletes DHEA-S while elevating cortisol
• Optimal ratios support healthy stress response

Inflammatory Markers (Primary Focus)
• hsCRP, white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio track stress-induced inflammation
• Chronic stress activates inflammatory pathways systemically
• Elevated inflammation from stress accelerates cardiovascular disease and aging
• Stress-related inflammation often appears before subjective burnout awareness

Metabolic Stress Indicators (Secondary)
• HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin can elevate with chronic stress
• Stress hormones impair glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
• Cortisol drives metabolic dysfunction independent of diet
• These markers show stress impact on metabolic health

Cardiovascular Stress Markers (Secondary)
• Lipid panels (total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides) affected by chronic stress
• Blood pressure (when measured) sensitive to stress levels
• Stress increases cardiovascular disease risk through multiple pathways
• Immune markers (white blood cells) reflect stress-related immune suppression

Why 27% Weighting?
While 35 biomarkers track stress consequences, the 27% biomarker emphasis reflects that these markers show long-term damage rather than current stress experience. Biomarkers lag behind perception, someone can feel extremely stressed for months before inflammation or metabolic markers deteriorate.

Additionally, many stress-related biomarkers (inflammation, metabolic dysfunction) overlap with other pillars. The modest 27% weighting prevents double-counting these markers while acknowledging that chronic stress does eventually leave measurable physiological signatures.

What Improvement Looks Like
Stress reduction produces measurable physiological recovery:
• hsCRP decreases by 20-40% with stress management interventions
• Cortisol rhythms normalize with consistent stress reduction practices
• HbA1c improves when stress-related glucose dysregulation resolves
• Inflammatory markers decrease within 2-4 months of sustained stress reduction

Your behavioral score captures perceived stress levels, stress triggers, coping strategies, and resilience practices. This component measures your subjective stress experience and how effectively you manage stress responses.

Categories of Behaviors

Perceived Stress Levels (Primary Focus)
• Frequency and intensity of feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope
• Daily stress experience and stress persistence
• Sense of control over life circumstances
• Emotional reactivity to stressors
• Recovery time after stressful events

Stress Sources and Triggers (Primary Focus)
• Work-related stress (demands, control, support)
• Financial stress and economic concerns
• Relationship stress (family, romantic, social)
• Health-related stress and medical concerns
• Time pressure and scheduling overwhelm

Coping Strategies (Secondary)
• Active coping vs. avoidance behaviors
• Problem-focused vs. emotion-focused coping
• Healthy vs. unhealthy stress outlets
• Stress awareness and early recognition

• Mindfulness and meditation practices
• Breathing exercises and relaxation techniques
• Physical activity for stress management
• Social support utilization
• Professional help-seeking when needed
• Boundary-setting and saying no
• Time management and prioritization

Why 63% Weighting?
Stress management requires heavy behavioral emphasis (63%) because stress is fundamentally subjective. External circumstances matter far less than your perception and response. Someone experiencing objectively minimal stressors can have severe stress if they lack coping skills, while someone facing major stressors may thrive with strong resilience practices.

Self-reported stress levels predict health outcomes as reliably as many objective measures. How you experience stress, what triggers your stress response, and how you cope determine stress impact on health. The 63% behavioral weighting ensures your lived experience of stress receives proper emphasis over delayed biomarker changes.

What Improvement Looks Like
Stress management behavioral improvements are immediately felt:
• Reducing perceived stress from "very often" to "sometimes" overwhelmed
• Identifying and modifying key stress triggers
• Implementing daily stress reduction practices (10 minutes of meditation)
• Improving stress recovery time (from days to hours)
• Building healthy coping mechanisms (exercise, social connection) vs. unhealthy outlets (alcohol, avoidance)

Your biomarker score uses only indirect inflammatory and stress markers to capture the physiological consequences of social isolation and lack of purpose. These 4 biomarkers don''t measure connection quality, they measure the chronic stress and inflammation that result from loneliness.

Categories of Markers

Inflammatory Consequences of Isolation (Primary Focus)
• hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) tracks chronic inflammation
• Social isolation activates inflammatory pathways similar to chronic disease
• Loneliness creates measurable inflammatory burden within months
• Chronic inflammation from isolation accelerates aging and disease

Stress Hormone Dysregulation (Secondary)
• Cortisol (when measured) shows stress response to isolation
• DHEA-S reflects hormonal balance affected by social connection
• Lack of social support elevates stress hormone activation
• Social connection buffers stress hormone responses

Why Only 18% Weighting?
Connection quality cannot be measured through blood work. The 18% biomarker component represents only 4 markers (hsCRP, cortisol, DHEA-S, and white blood cell count) that indirectly reflect social isolation''s physiological consequences.

These markers measure chronic stress and inflammation that can result from loneliness, but they don''t capture the positive aspects of social connection, relationship quality, sense of purpose, or community engagement. Many factors besides social isolation affect these same markers (diet, exercise, sleep, other stressors).

The minimal biomarker weighting acknowledges that social connection''s health benefits extend far beyond these few indirect measurements. This is one pillar where behavioral assessment is vastly more important than biomarkers.

What Improvement Looks Like
While connection improvements may not dramatically shift biomarkers in the short term, long-term benefits include:
• hsCRP decreases modestly with increased social engagement
• Stress markers normalize as social support buffers life stressors
• Inflammatory markers improve over 6-12 months with sustained connection building

However, the real benefits of connection appear in behavioral and psychological domains that biomarkers don''t capture, the sense of belonging, purpose, meaning, and social support that make life worth living.',

Categories of Behaviors

Relationship Quality (Primary Focus)
• Quality of close relationships (partner, family, close friends)
• Emotional intimacy and vulnerability in relationships
• Relationship satisfaction and support
• Frequency of meaningful conversations
• Feeling understood and valued by others

Social Integration (Primary Focus)
• Number and diversity of social connections
• Frequency of social interaction and engagement
• Participation in group activities and communities
• Sense of belonging to social groups
• Social role diversity (different contexts for connection)

Sense of Purpose (Secondary)
• Clarity about life purpose and meaning
• Engagement in activities that feel meaningful
• Contribution to something larger than self
• Alignment between values and daily life
• Future goals and sense of direction

Community Engagement (Secondary)
• Involvement in community organizations or causes
• Volunteering and service to others
• Civic engagement and participation
• Religious or spiritual community involvement
• Neighborhood connection and local engagement

Why 72% Weighting?
Connection and purpose require the heaviest behavioral emphasis (72%) of any pillar because these qualities are fundamentally subjective and relational. There are no blood tests for relationship quality, sense of purpose, or community belonging.

Self-reported connection quality predicts mortality risk as powerfully as smoking status. Research consistently shows that people with strong social connections live longer, healthier lives independent of other health behaviors. How you experience relationships, whether you feel purposeful, and your sense of community integration cannot be captured by biomarkers.

The 72% behavioral weighting reflects reality: assessing social and existential health requires self-report. This is one domain where subjective assessment isn''t a limitation, it''s the only valid measurement approach.

What Improvement Looks Like
Connection and purpose improvements are deeply felt:
• Increasing close friendships from 1-2 to 3-5 people
• Improving relationship quality (from superficial to emotionally intimate)
• Regular social engagement (from isolated to weekly group activities)
• Developing sense of purpose (from directionless to meaningful contribution)
• Building community involvement (from disconnected to active participant)
• Strengthening existing relationships through vulnerability and presence

Screening-Related Biomarkers (Secondary)
• Cancer markers (when appropriate for age/risk)
• Vitamin D (bone health and immune function)
• Iron markers (anemia screening)
• Complete blood count (overall health status)

Why 49.5% Weighting?
Core Care uses balanced biomarker emphasis (49.5%) because preventive health requires both objective measurements and behavioral engagement. With 23 biomarkers tracking foundational health, the near-50% biomarker weighting captures baseline physiological status across major organ systems.

These markers represent the minimum health monitoring that should occur regularly for everyone. They catch treatable conditions early when interventions are most effective. The balanced weighting acknowledges that both knowing your numbers (biomarkers) and actually getting screenings (behaviors) matter equally.

Core Care biomarker improvements reflect early intervention success:
• Detecting prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) before diabetes develops
• Identifying elevated LDL (>130 mg/dL) before cardiovascular events
• Catching declining kidney function (eGFR <60) before dialysis needed

Why 40.5% Weighting?
Core Care requires substantial behavioral emphasis (40.5%) because preventive health is fundamentally about actions taken. Having perfect biomarkers today means nothing if you''re not scheduling screenings that could catch cancer early or maintaining relationships with providers who can intervene when problems arise.

Many critical preventive measures (mammography, colonoscopy, skin checks) can''t be captured by the 23 routine biomarkers. Someone could have excellent blood work but skip all cancer screenings and be at high risk. The 40.5% behavioral weighting ensures engagement with preventive healthcare receives proper credit.

The near-equal 50/50 split between biomarkers and behaviors reflects that Core Care requires both knowing your baseline health status (biomarkers) and actively engaging with healthcare system (behaviors).

What Improvement Looks Like
Core Care behavioral improvements are concrete and actionable:
• Completing overdue colonoscopy (age 45+)
• Scheduling annual physical after 3+ years without visit
• Establishing primary care relationship (if currently without provider)
• Completing age-appropriate cancer screenings
• Following up on abnormal test results within recommended timeframes
• Improving dental care from sporadic to twice-yearly visits
• Getting annual flu vaccination and staying current on immunizations

Your behavioral score tracks proactive health engagement that catches treatable problems before they become life-threatening diseases.',
