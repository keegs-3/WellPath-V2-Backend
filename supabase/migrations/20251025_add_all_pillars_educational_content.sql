Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin secretion when used in evening, delaying circadian rhythms. The content matters: educational/creative screen use differs from passive consumption. High screen time often displaces health-promoting activities: exercise, social interaction, sleep, outdoor time. Tracking screen time increases awareness and enables intentional use.',
